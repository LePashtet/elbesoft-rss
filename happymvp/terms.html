<p>
    This is a legally binding agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity), referred to herein as
    “YOU”, and Happymvp Inc, referred to herein as “Happymvp”. This web-based software entitled "News + Letter" and
    all documents and materials included in it are referred to herein as the “SOFTWARE” or the “DOCUMENTS”.
    Installing, opening, signing up, logging in, or using all or any portion of this web-based software indicates
    your acceptance of all the terms and conditions of this End-User License Agreement referred to herein as “EULA”
    and that this agreement is equivalent to a written agreement signed by you. By selecting the box “I AGREE” or
    performing a similar electronic function, such as Signing Up to a Free Trial, or Purchasing this product, you
    are providing your acceptance of the terms of this agreement. This agreement is enforceable against you and any
    legal entity that obtained the web-based software and on whose behalf it is used. If you do not agree to the
    terms of this agreement, please do not use this software.
</p>
<h3>
    It is illegal and strictly prohibited to distribute, publish, offer for sale, license or sublicense, give or
    disclose to any other party, this WEB-BASED SOFTWARE or the documents in hard copy, digital form or any other
    medium whether existing or not yet existing, except as specifically permitted below.
</h3>
<p>
    The use of this web-based software is governed by the terms and conditions set forth herein. Please read them
    carefully. This EULA is applicable to all of the Documents included in the Software and to the Software in its
    whole part. You are deemed to have read, understood and accepted the terms of this EULA when you install or use
    the Software.
</p>
<h2>1. Payment terms</h2>
<p>
    "News + Letter" is sold as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and requires Clients to have a valid membership
    subscription. We accept payments with Credit Cards and Visa and Mastercard Debit Cards. Your subscription will
    renew automatically at the end of the subscription term unless you opt-out from automatic renewal or cancel your
    membership. You can update your payment method, manage your subscription or cancel at any time by visiting the

    Billing page under your user account.
</p>
<p>
    By purchasing this software, you agreed to enroll in our automatic renewal service. This keeps your products up
    and running, automatically charging then-current renewal fees to your payment method on file, with no further
    action on your part.
</p> <h4>1.a. Account cancellation policy</h4>
<p>
    Once a user submits a request for cancellation, no additional charges will be made. However, no refunds are
    provided upon cancellation. If you cancel before an upcoming renewal date, you will have access to your Account
    through the end of the then-current year.
</p> <h4>1.b. Cancellation of automatic renewal</h4>
<p>
    Annual subscriptions purchased through the Happymvp Store will renew automatically at the end of the term. Your
    credit card is charged at the end of each subscription period and a renewal confirmation notice is sent to the
    account administrator’s email address. Notification of upcoming renewal is sent to the account administrator’s
    email address 21 days before renewal. If you wish to turn off the automated renewal, you can do so any time from
    your online account under My Account/Billing.
</p> <h4>1.c. Free trial</h4>
<p>
    Happymvp offers a free trial version for "News + Letter". &nbsp;We do not request credit card information when
    signing up to the free trial. The free trial allows anyone to see a preview of each template of the software.
    The free trial, however, does not allow you to Download, Export, Print or to Cut/Copy/Paste/Save the templates.
    You need to purchase and activate the software in order to be able to fully download and edit the templates.
</p> <h4>1.d. Failed renewal &amp; account suspension</h4>
<p>
    If your credit card on file is closed or expired, or if for any reason, a charge is rejected, you will be
    requested to update your Billing Information and supply a new payment to keep your account active. If a charge
    is rejected, your access to the "News + Letter" software will be suspended until you update your account
    information and the payment is successful.
</p>

    have the license to use the Documents. Use by any other person, company, affiliate, corporation, Limited

    secrets, methods, processes or procedures or any other confidential, financial or business information of the

        of
        the normal negotiation process or as part of your representation in a bona fide attorney-client
        relationship.
