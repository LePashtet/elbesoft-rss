<h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
<p>
    The Happymvp Platform (which includes our website and the "News + Letter" app) uses cookies, in combination
    with pixels, local storage objects, and similar devices (collectively, “cookies” unless otherwise noted) to
    distinguish you from other users of the Happymvp Platform. This helps us provide you with a good experience,
    improve our service, and to personalize ads and content to you while you use the Happymvp Platform.
</p>
<p>
    This cookie policy (“Cookie Policy”) describes the types of cookies we use on the Happymvp Platform and our
    purposes for using them.
</p>
<p>
    If you have questions about this Cookie Policy, or if you would like a detailed list of the cookies that we
    currently use on the Happymvp Platform, please contact us at hello@happymvp.com . For more information about our
    privacy
    practices, please review our privacy policy: www.happymvp.com/newsletter/privacy-policy .
</p>
<h2>1. Your consent</h2>
<p>
    You consent to placement of cookies on your browser by us and our third party service providers. Please read
    this Cookie Policy carefully for details about why we use cookies and the information they collect from and
    about you.
</p>
<h2>2. Withdraw your consent at any time</h2>
<p>
    If you do not wish to accept cookies in connection with your use of the Happymvp Platform, you will need to
    delete, and block or disable cookies via your browser settings; see below for more information on how to do
    this. Please note that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of the Happymvp Platform, and may prevent
    you from being able to access certain features on the Happymvp Platform.
</p>
<h2>3. What is a cookie?</h2>
<p>
    A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your device.
    Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies as
    soon as you visit the Happymvp Platform.
</p>
<h2>4. Key concepts</h2>
<p><b><u>FIRST AND THIRD-PARTY COOKIES</u></b>: whether a cookie is 'first' or 'third' party refers to the domain
    placing the cookie.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user at the time (e.g., cookies
        placed by www.newsletter.happymvp.com).
    </li>
    <li>
        Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the
        user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a
        third-party cookie.
    </li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>PERSISTENT COOKIES</u></b>: these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the
    cookie. They are activated
    each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.
</p>
<p><b><u>SESSION COOKIES</u></b>: these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser
    session. A browser
    session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session
    cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
</p>
<h2>5. How to delete and block our cookies</h2>
<p>
    Most web browsers allow some control of most cookies through the browser settings. However, if you use your
    browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies), you may not be able to access all or parts
    of the Happymvp Platform. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our
    system will issue cookies as soon as you visit the Happymvp Platform.
</p>
<p><b><u>CHANGING YOUR COOKIE SETTINGS</u></b>. The browser settings for changing your cookies settings are usually
    found in the 'options' or 'preferences'
    menu of your internet browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful.
    Otherwise you should use the 'Help' option in your internet browser for more details.
